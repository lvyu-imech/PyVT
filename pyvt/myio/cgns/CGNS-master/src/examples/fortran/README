This contains a number of Fortran test cases to test the CGNS library.

***** NOTE *****
You will first have to edit the Makefile include to set up your
CGNS location and compiler and options

Edit 'make.defs' for Linux/Unix or Windows using gmake.
Edit 'make.win" for Windows using nmake

To just build the code, use
    make
on linux/Unix, or
    nmake -f Makefile.win
on Windows

To build and run the tests, use
    make test
or
    nmake -f Makefile.win test

To clean everything up, use
    make clean
or
    nmake -f Makefile.win clean

If you just want to look at a specific example, then cd to the
directory and use the make commands above there.

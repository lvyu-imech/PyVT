This contains a set of Fortran90 test cases from UserGuideCode.
(modified for use with V3.3)

If CGNS is compiled with --enable-64bit, then the created "grid.cgns"
file will use 64-bit integers as appropriate

Currently, the testing (make test) only compares output files of some
of the variables written to and read from the grid.cgns file.  It
does not check whether the 64-bit integers were necessarily written
as I8 or not.  To check this, one could use "cgnsview" to look at the
grid.cgns file(s) directly.  For example, with 64-bit integers, in
the cgns file under Test_Grid_Str, the PointList data type under
the BC_t nodes (under ZoneBC_t) should be I8 rather than I4.

***** NOTE *****
You will first have to edit the Makefile include to set up your
CGNS location and compiler and options

Edit 'make.defs' for Linux/Unix
Not checked for Windows yet.

To just build the code, use
    make
on linux/Unix

To build and run the tests, use
    make test

Note: executables, output files, and the resulting CGNS file are put in
each Subdirectory/build/ directory

To clean everything up, use
    make clean
